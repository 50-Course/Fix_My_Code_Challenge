# Fix My Code Challenge :technologist: :syringe: :bug:

The project is segmented into 4 tasks, each written in a different language.
The objective is to learn to debug code effectively, irrespective of the underlying language.


## Tasks :pushpin:

### Task 1

Please take a look at the original implementation of FizzBuzz in Python: [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/master/0-fizzbuzz.py)

Something is going wrongâ€¦.

```
$ ./0-fizzbuzz.py 50
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 Fizz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz Fizz 37 38 Fizz Buzz 41 Fizz 43 44 Fizz 46 47 Fizz 49 Buzz
$
```

15 should print FizzBuzz not Fizz

My solution: [0-fizzbuzz.py][1]
